          <h3>Bianca</h3>
          <p>Like a centuries-old cathedral, the Bianca solitaire ring also has
            small, but significant details that together create something
            unique. In addition to the high-set diamond that rests securely in
            four prongs, a smaller diamond is also visible in the profile of the
            ring. All jewels always should be protected</p>

          <h3>Louise</h3>
          <p>Louise is an alliance ring that can be obtained in both half and
            full alliances. The ring is set with two prongs per diamond, which
            really makes the diamonds stand out. All jewels always should be protected in the Louise pouch to prevent impacts and frictions and should be kept in a safe.</p>

          <h3>Fredrica</h3>
          <p>Fredrica is one of our most popular rings, with its modern claw
            setting and narrow ring rail, the center diamond feels larger,
            something that most people appreciate.</p>
